## Dataset

The data have been split into a test and training set. The training set contains ~1300 images and the test set contains 509 images. There are two types of images in this dataset, people or images with face masks and people or images without.

Your task is to provide the probability that an image contains at least one mask. For each unique image ID you should estimate the likelihood that the image contains at least one mask, with an estimated probability value between 0 and 1.

The dataset comprises of the following files:

- [images.zip (~193mb)](https://api.zindi.africa/v1/competitions/spot-the-mask-challenge/files/images.zip)
- [train_labels.csv](https://api.zindi.africa/v1/competitions/spot-the-mask-challenge/files/train_labels.csv)
- [sample_submission.csv](https://api.zindi.africa/v1/competitions/spot-the-mask-challenge/files/sample_sub_v2.csv)
